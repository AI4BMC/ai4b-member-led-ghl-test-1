                explanation: "Joanne's golden rule is 'You must select it to affect it!'

This is fundamental to working efficiently in the platform."

Without this step, visitors must type '/home' after your domain. Joanne emphasizes: 'A lot of people aren't aware of this last little step, and then they can't figure out why they get a 404 error.'"

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Negative margins create overlapping effects between elements. Joanne demonstrates this with the 'karate school' headline using -20px to overlap it with 'ROUNDHOUSE', and later with the staff section using -80px to pull instructor cards up into the black section. This technique isn't self-explanatory but enables sophisticated design effects."

She warns: 'As soon as you start configuring things differently... it can get wonky and confusing.' The pages become partially disconnected when you start customizing mobile separately, making it much harder to manage."
